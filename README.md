# Project Two: Booking System Design

## :snowman:Description

For this project, you will work in self-selected teams of three or four students to design a booking system for purchasing tickets for travel, movies, concerts, or sporting events, or a similar system for ordering food online.

In all of those types of systems, users must be able to book a purchase for a certain number of people, for a certain event taking place at a particular time. There are then also the details like the destination for a flight, bus, or train; or the specific movie or concert. And finally there is the problem of reserving a specific seat or a block of seats: seating charts to clarify what seats someone is purchasing, or a menu displaying food items available for order. You must also design a simple form for accepting payment by credit card.

Your design, which you will test with actual users for Project Three, must accomodate all of those kinds of choices and others that you identify. You should begin by conducting a competitive task-analysis of other, similar booking sites. Take extensive notes of the patterns that you see. Which work? Which could be improved upon? And what entirely new ideas do you and your team have for streamlining the user experience of these types of multifacted tasks?
