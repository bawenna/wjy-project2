## Pros of Webpage

* Price filter which allow users to select tickets within the price range that they want.
* The event name, time and location are always on top of the website throughout the process.
* Highlighting the input boxes in red if the information entered is not correct and shows error messages.
* The ticketing page and payment page are both simple and clean.
* The total payment follows the screen when scrolling.

## Cons of Webpage

* Users have to get an account in order to purchase the tickets. This is annoying to some users who only would use this website for once in their life.
* The pop-up window for price filtering and choosing number of seats is extra because the functions can also be accessed easily in the main ticketing page.
* The errors messages are not close to the input boxes, users have to scroll down from the error message box to see the form. (Some problems with its JavaScript, only the error messages for 'State','Exp Month', and 'Card Type' show under the input box, if they did those in purpose, well then...it is not a good design and the same error messages are repeated at the error message box.)

## Ideas for Our Own Webpage

* Allow users check out as a guest.
* Always show event related information on a place where it has high visibility through out the process.
* Create simple and clean layout and design for the webpages.
