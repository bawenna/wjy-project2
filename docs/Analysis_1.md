* (we wanted to show through videos on how these booking systems actually look
  like and really interact with the user)

## Pros of Webpage

* Before started, ask user amount of the tickets to precise availability
* Picture of actual area
  * Zoom in and zoom out function
  * Various filter options available
  * When click a specific area, the ticket price for that area will be filtered
  * When hover on a specific price, the area for that price will be highlighted
* Use the word 'Required' to show the required area in the form that users need to fill out.


## Cons of Webpage

* Validation needs to be improved. In the video, author put letters instead of numbers in 'Zip' and 'Phone' and still submitted the form successfully.
* You have to sign up in order to purchase a ticket

## Ideas for Our Own Webpage

* Get a diagram drawn for IIT auditorium
* Some of the filtering rules can be applied to our webpage
* Tell users which information fields are  required to fill out.
