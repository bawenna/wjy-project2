### Link to Our Video Demonstration

* (We wanted to show through videos on how these booking systems actually look
  like and really interact with the user)

### Pros of Webpage

* Before started, ask user amount of the tickets to precise availability
* Picture of actual area
  * Zoom in and zoom out function
  * Various filter options available
  * When click a specific area, the ticket price for that area will be filtered
  * When hover on a specific price, the area for that price will be highlighted
* After event is chosen, displays photo in which allows the user to see the area in which the tickets are available in
* Lets you filter out the areas you prefer to be seated in
* Use the word "Required" to show the required area in the form that users need to fill out

### Cons of Webpage

* Validation needs to be improved. In the video, author put letters instead of
  numbers in "Zip" and "Phone" and still submitted the form successfully
* Does not always correct you and
* You have to sign up in order to purchase a ticket
* The complete separate page to choosing country and delivery can be combined
  with payment or even confirmation; There is no need to make the user feel like
  it’s a lot of work to get a ticket for an event
* This also makes it evident that the billing area and payment area could probably
  share a page in which also permits the user to just enter they’re information all
  at the same time and they won’t feel like they’re going to have to enter the
  same information again and again


### Ideas for Our Own Webpage

* Get a diagram drawn for IIT auditorium
* Some of the filtering rules can be applied to our webpage
* Tell users which information fields are required to fill out
* Keep the layout and colors of the page simple; White and red go really well,
  especially with ours being IIT themed
