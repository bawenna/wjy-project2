### Introduction

Have you ever been to an event where you go with a group of people and you all
don’t have seats together and it’s just at the IIT auditorium? Or have you ever
gone to an event where you spend too much time try to find a seat in the auditorium?
Well, get ready for IIT Talk!

### Problem

When it comes to an event, there are many issues that can arise like:

* Knowing how to set up a sound system
* Getting the seats filled
* Knowing what events are taking place
* Payment efficiency

### Solution

For the events that will take plans in the IIT auditorium the solution will be
IIT Talk booking system! The functions of it will be:

* Book tickets
* Choose seats
* Choose the Talk time event
* Make Payment/Check out
	* Card Holder Name
	* Card #
	* Expiration Date
	* Zip code
* Print ticket with Name of the Talk/Time/Date/Seat# (Maybe generate a barcode/sent ticket to phone)

Also for the people who are running the event, they will be able to:

* See how many people will be attending
* Track much money has been collected
* See which talks are most popular
* Being able to have a ticket so they can more effectively get people in there seats and the auditorium
