## Ticketmaster

[Ticketmaster](https://www.ticketmaster.com/) is where "buy tickets concerts,
sports, arts, theater and other events". Find more tickets and options before
you going to any venues so you will have guaranteed seats.

### Pros of Webpage

* Show a clear and simple list of events that they can purchase tickets for with
  the date on the left hand side of them
* When it shows the display of the arena, it has a nice division in which it shows
  the user how the stage and seats are set up, but yet, they still have to the
  right how much the tickets are for that event (give them a good idea on what theyâ€™re paying for)
* Price filter which allow users to select tickets within the price range that they want
* The event name, time, and location are always on top of the website throughout the process
* Highlighting the input boxes in red if the information entered is not correct and shows error messages
* The ticketing page and payment page are both simple and clean
* The price follows the screen when scrolling

### Cons of Webpage

* Users have to get an account in order to purchase the tickets. This is annoying
  to some users who only would use this website for once in their life
* The pop-up window for price filtering and choosing number of seats is extra because
  the functions can also be accessed easily in the main ticketing page
* The errors messages are not close to the input boxes, users have to scroll down
  from the error message box to see the form. (Some problems with its JavaScript,
  only the error messages for "State", "Exp Month", and "Card Type" show under the
  input box, if they did those in purpose, well then... It is not a good design and
  the same error messages are repeated at the error message box)


### Ideas for Our Own Webpage

* Allow users check out as a guest
* Always show event related information on a place where it has high visibility through out the process
* Create simple and clean layout and design for the webpages
* When validation comes up saying user didn't write the information right, to
  display small message say "please enter a 5 digit area code", unlike here where
  they only let you know for some of them
